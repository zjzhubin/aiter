--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**AITER** (AI Tensor Engine for ROCm) is AMD's high-performance AI operator library, providing optimized GPU kernels for inference and training workloads on ROCm. It serves as a unified collection of production-ready operators that framework developers can integrate directly into their stacks.

### Key Features

- **C++ and Python APIs** — use operators from either level
- **Multiple kernel backends** — Triton, Composable Kernel (CK), and hand-tuned ASM
- **Inference and training** — not just serving kernels, but also training and GEMM+communication fused kernels
- **Framework-agnostic** — integrate into vLLM, SGLang, or any custom framework

## Ecosystem

AITER is the **default kernel backend for LLM inference on AMD GPUs**, integrated into the major serving frameworks and powering production workloads at scale.

### Framework Integration

| Framework | Integration | Status | Operators Used |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**vLLM**](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) | Default attention backend on ROCm | Production | MHA, MLA, Paged Attention, Fused MoE, GEMM, RMSNorm, RoPE+KVCache |
| [**SGLang**](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) | Default on ROCm Docker | Production | Attention, Fused MoE, Block-scale GEMM, All-reduce, RMSNorm |
| [**ATOM**](https://github.com/ROCm/ATOM) | Built natively on AITER | Active development | All AITER operators (attention, MoE, sampling, communication) |
| [**JAX**](https://github.com/ROCm/jax-aiter) | XLA FFI bridge, no PyTorch dependency | Experimental | MHA/FMHA, RMSNorm, BF16 GEMM |
| Various customer proprietary inference engines | Kernel-level integration | Production | Attention, MoE, GEMM, quantization |

### Performance Highlights

| Operator | Speedup |
|---|---|
| MLA decode kernel | up to **17x** |
| [MHA prefill kernel](op_tests/cpp/mha/README.md) | up to **14x** |
| Block-scaled Fused MoE | up to **3x** |
| Block-scaled GEMM | up to **2x** |
| DeepSeek-R1 e2e (SGLang) | 6,484 → **13,704** tok/s (2.1x) |
| JAX-AITER attention (MI350) | **4.39x** median |

> For detailed benchmarks, see the [ATOM Benchmark Dashboard](https://rocm.github.io/ATOM/benchmark-dashboard/).

### Supported Hardware

| GPU | Architecture | Status |
|---|---|---|
| AMD Instinct MI300X | gfx942 (CDNA3) | Fully supported |
| AMD Instinct MI325X | gfx942 (CDNA3) | Fully supported |
| AMD Instinct MI350 | gfx950 (CDNA4) | Supported |
| AMD Instinct MI355X | gfx950 (CDNA4) | Supported |
| AMD Pro W7900 | gfx1100 (RDNA3) | Experimental<sup>1</sup> |
| AMD AI Max and Max Pro 400/300 Series | gfx1151 (RDNA3.5) | Experimental<sup>1</sup> |
| AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 | gfx1201 (RDNA4) | Experimental<sup>1</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> On RDNA, Triton and most FlyDSL kernels run, as do most HIP kernels (norm, RoPE, quant, activation, plus some GEMM/attention). Most CK and ASM kernels are CDNA-only.

## Operators

AITER provides optimized kernels for attention, MoE, GEMM, normalization, quantization, communication, and more. Each operator has unit tests under [`op_tests/`](op_tests/) that you can run directly:

```bash
# Example: run a single operator test
python3 op_tests/test_mha.py
python3 op_tests/test_mla.py
python3 op_tests/test_moe.py
python3 op_tests/test_gemm_a8w8.py
python3 op_tests/test_rmsnorm2d.py

# See all available operator tests
ls op_tests/test_*.py
```

## Release Plan

AITER publishes a scheduled release every two weeks. Each scheduled release uses a release branch named after the target version, such as `release/v0.1.20`, and a matching release tag, such as `v0.1.20`. The normal version progression moves from one scheduled release tag to the next, for example `v0.1.19` to `v0.1.20`.

For scheduled releases, automation creates any missing `release/vX.Y.Z` branch and matching `vX.Y.Z` tag from the configured release source ref, which defaults to `main`. The tag must point at the release branch HEAD. The GitHub Release page is created with the release branch as the target, generated notes are diffed against the previous scheduled tag, and the notes state the diff base.

If a hotfix is required after a release, the fix is cherry-picked onto the corresponding release branch and published as a post-release tag. Post-releases use the `.postN` suffix, for example `v0.1.20.post1`. Post-release tags must already exist on the matching release branch; automation refuses to create a post tag from `main`.

Release automation validates that the release tag points at the matching release branch HEAD, builds manylinux_2_28 wheels for ROCm 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 with Python 3.10 and 3.12, validates that exactly six wheels were produced, and uploads the complete wheel set to the matching GitHub Release. It does not upload partial wheel sets.

## Installation

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ROCm/aiter.git
cd aiter
python3 setup.py develop
```

If you happen to forget the `--recursive` during `clone`, you can use the following command after `cd aiter`
```bash
git submodule sync && git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### FlyDSL

AITER uses [FlyDSL](https://github.com/ROCm/FlyDSL)-based kernels across a range of operators (e.g., GEMM and MoE). FlyDSL is a required dependency and is installed automatically when you run `python3 setup.py develop`.

To install it manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Triton

AITER includes Triton-based operators that require triton from AMD PyPI, with the correct version selected based on your ROCm installation.

If you install with `python3 setup.py develop`, triton is installed automatically. To skip this and keep your existing triton, set:

```bash
AITER_USE_SYSTEM_TRITON=1 python3 setup.py develop
```

If you use `pip install -e .`, run the install script manually:

```bash
./.github/scripts/install_triton.sh
```

### Opus — Lightweight C++ Template for Kernel Development

[Opus](csrc/include/opus/) is a single-header C++ template library (`opus.hpp`) for writing HIP kernels on AMD GPUs — vectorized load/store, layout abstractions, and MFMA wrappers with a strong focus on **build time optimization** (up to 61x faster than standard torch extension builds). See the [Opus README](csrc/include/opus/README.md) and [`op_tests/opus/`](op_tests/opus/) for details.

### Triton-based Communication (Iris)

AITER supports GPU-initiated communication using the [Iris library](https://github.com/ROCm/iris). This enables high-performance Triton-based communication primitives like reduce-scatter and all-gather.

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-triton-comms.txt
```

For more details, see [docs/triton_comms.md](docs/triton_comms.md).
